🎮 Simon Game Challenge
🕹️ How to Play
The Simon Game is a classic memory-based game that tests your ability to recall and repeat sequences of colors and sounds. The game progressively becomes more challenging as the sequence gets longer after each round.

📌 Rules:
The game starts with a single color flashing on the screen.
The player must click/tap the same color to repeat the sequence.
If the player gets it right, the game adds another color to the sequence and repeats the pattern.
The player must then recall and repeat the full sequence in the correct order.
If the player makes a mistake, the game ends, and they can restart to try again.
The challenge is to see how long you can keep up with the growing sequence!
🎯 Objective
Test your memory skills by repeating the longest sequence possible. Keep playing to beat your highest score!
